# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# .SYNOPSIS
#   This pipeline is the main pipeline that contains the top level stages for the deployment
# using other YAML templates as references both locally and from the common library
# .DESCRIPTION
#   This pipeline will:
#  1. Add the common-library for shared pipeline references, which include
#     a. YAML references for Image Builder to deploy custom images and / or containers
#     b. YAML references for Terraform Init, Plan, and Apply, which contain references to common bash scripts

# .ASSUMPTIONS:
#     1. Looping is not needed for environment stages due to different parameters per environment
#     2. Terraform steps are the same across all projects (setup, init, plan, apply)
